# Next Word Prediction with LSTM (Jupyter Notebook)

This project is a deep learning model for predicting the next word in a text sequence. Built with TensorFlow and Keras in a Jupyter notebook, the model uses an LSTM neural network trained on an FAQ dataset to provide real-time word suggestions based on input sequences.

## Project Overview

In this notebook, you’ll find:
- *Data Preprocessing*: Tokenization and sequence padding for training.
- *LSTM Model*: A deep learning model that predicts the next word based on prior context.
- *Prediction Function*: Code to make predictions on new sequences.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Numpy

## How It Works

1. *Data Preparation*: The FAQ text data is preprocessed, tokenized, and converted into sequences.
2. *Model Training*: An LSTM-based neural network is trained on the sequences to learn language patterns.
3. *Next Word Prediction*: The trained model predicts possible next words for given input sequences.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Install the required libraries by running:

bash
pip install tensorflow numpy


### Running the Notebook

1. Clone the repository or download the .ipynb file.
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
3. Follow the cells to preprocess the data, train the model, and run predictions.

### Training the Model

In the notebook:
- *Tokenize*: The text data is split and tokenized using Keras' Tokenizer.
- *Model Definition*: The LSTM model is defined and compiled.
- *Training*: The model is trained on tokenized sequences.

### Making Predictions

The notebook includes a function to make predictions on new text inputs. Simply run the cell to input your text and see next-word predictions generated by the model.

## Example

After training, you can input text such as monthly subscription in the cell provided to see predictions, like once, the, course, etc.

## Future Enhancements

- *Extended Training Data*: Enhance the model’s accuracy by training on larger datasets.
- *Improved UI*: Integrate with a web-based UI for more interactive suggestions.
- *Export Model*: Convert the model for use in real-time applications or deploy on a server.
